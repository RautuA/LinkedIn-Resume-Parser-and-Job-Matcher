This repository contains a set of Python scripts for parsing LinkedIn profiles and job descriptions, as well as matching profiles to job descriptions based on various criteria. The tools included in this repository help in extracting and analyzing key details from resumes and job postings to facilitate efficient job matching.

## Features

- **LinkedIn Profile Parsing:** Extracts detailed information from LinkedIn profiles, including name, title, experience, education, skills, and certifications.
- **Job Description Parsing:** Extracts essential information from job descriptions, including title, required experience, preferred education, skills, and certifications.
- **Profile-to-Job Matching:** Scores and ranks profiles against job descriptions based on skills, certifications, experience, and education to find the best matches.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RautuA/LinkedIn-Resume-Parser-and-Job-Matcher.git
    cd LinkedIn-Resume-Parser-and-Job-Matcher
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
